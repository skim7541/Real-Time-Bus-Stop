# Mapbox Marker Assignment

In this assignment, I added a Mapbox marker to a web page using the Mapbox GL JavaScript library. The marker will be placed at specific coordinates on the map.

## Instructions

Go to this web app [here](https://arizonasolid-lunarvictor.codio.io/student_code/index.html) and Click on the "Show Stops Between MIT and Harvar". You will start to see the bus pin move along the bustop.
